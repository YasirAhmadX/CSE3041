## Practice Questions

## 1
## Represent the height in cm infotmation of a team of 12 basketball players as a matrix of dimension 4x3 in row major form.
```{r}
Team <-  matrix(c(120,112,122,113,132,109,115,117,115,118,120,119),4,3)
Team
```
## 2
## Access height at row 3 columns 2
```{r}
Team[3,2]
```

## 3
## Display all heights in row 2
```{r}
Team[2,]
```

## 4
## Display all heights in columns 3
```{r}
Team[,3]
```

## 5
## Extract the heights in all rows but only for columns 1 and 3
```{r}
Team[,c(1,3)]
```

## 6
## Transpose of heights
```{r}
t(Team)
```

## 7
## Add four more player into the matrix
```{r}
Team = cbind(Team,c(114,125,122,119))
Team
```

## 8
